No Thanks

**********
**RULES**

*Objective*
To finish with the lowest score

*Setup*
* Give 11 tokens to each player
* Get a deck of (suitless) cards numbered 3 to 35
* Remove 9 cards from the deck at random
* Flip the top card of the deck face up

*Gameplay*
The game ends when there are no cards left in the deck

1. The current player may either take the face up card or, if they have tokens, pass
2. If they take the card:
    a. They collect any tokens on the card
    b. They put the card face up in front of them
    c. They flip over the next card in the deck and start a new turn
3. If they pass, they put a token on the card and it is the next player's turn

*Scoring*
* Tokens are worth -1 point each
* Single cards are worth their value
* A sequence of cards is worth the value of the lowest card in the sequence

Example: 6 tokens and cards 1, 2, 8, 30, 31, 32 would be worth 33 points (-6 + 1 + 8 + 30)
